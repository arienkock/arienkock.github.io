I've tried conducting interviews with developers in different ways, and I've learned a few things from my own experiences:

1. People tend to have enough interviews going on around the same time that an hour and a half long coding test is more of an annoyance than a welcome challenge.
2. Coding tests don't kickstart a technical assesment any more than words do.
3. Coding tests usually don't showcase the candidate's intent.
4. Day to day challenges require "Googling it", which coding challenges try to circumvent.

The latest interview I decided to do a pair programming exercise. It's more of a "talk me through your process while solving a fictional issue"-exercise. This was much more effective in showcasing this candidate's experience, proficiency with his/her preferred IDE, and basic Java language knowledge.

## How is that any different?
You might say: "..but that's still a coding test". I suppose that's true. However, the best part is that I could see the person doing the coding test which told me a lot more than simply looking at the end-product.

The candidate struggled with something. That's not the end of the exercise. I help out of course, because the exercise was about to challenge them in a new and different aspect of a developer's tasks.
