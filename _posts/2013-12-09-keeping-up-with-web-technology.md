After getting into Spring Roo I had a look at JBoss Seam, which does some of the same RAD stuff. JBoss Forge is actually eerily similar to Spring Roo. I don't know enough about it yet, but [it doesn't look different enough](http://forge.jboss.org/docs/using/faq.html). While looking at videos I found this interesting [video that summarizes JVM Web Frameworks](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDGAQXyp19s) (my niche). Then one thing struck me...

I was agreeing with that video as though 
> "Yes, that is the tech I am familiar with. You are accurately describing my eco-system." 

only to find out that video is __more than 2 years old__. Since I only really started making an effort to "get with it" about a year ago, I am not surprised I have some catching up to do.

I went looking for this guy's web presence and found a [very relevant blog post](http://burrsutter.blogspot.nl/2013/11/personal-technology-radar-how-to-keep-up.html) about this topic. Burr Sutter's (the guy from the webinar video) personal account of how he's running out of time to keep up with new developments would apply to a lot of developers, including me. He is in a better position to "keep up" since his frequenting of conferences and knowing people "in the know", is something the majority of developers can't afford/do. That is NOT to say we can't make more of an effort (slight dig to myself).

I have a Twitter account that I use to try and follow people that post things in my blind spot that I find interesting: front-end tech, mostly. If it were not for some Mozilla trend a few weeks ago, I would not have found out about [asm.js](https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/tag/asm-js/). My imagination started running wild with the ideas of what high performance code delivered through a browser could actually DO! I'm sorry to say the first thing I thought of was a Bitcoin generator client distributed discretely by a high-traffic website. Shame on me.

As I review the state of the art of JVM Web Frameworks, not ignoring stuff like [Compojure/Ring](https://github.com/weavejester/compojure), I get the feeling that there are two opposing forces in the world of Web Applications. 

1. That of the full-stack, fully integrated, development pipeline
2. Opposed by the multi-tooled, cutom tailored, cherry picked solution

I have to say that before writing it down like that I was cursing the lack of __even MORE__ integration. However, I have been shouting for the longest time that "enterprise" is a dirty word, and that a quality solution built to the specific needs of a company will have better adoption and lower total cost of ownership than an out of the box, one size fits all application needing years of integration work. Now this is a gut feeling based on personal experience and I am not allowed to name names. Anecdotal evidence tells me that service providing companies like IBM will feed the fears of large corporations; telling them that "your continuity is too precious to risk on something you have so little experience with". "Let US take care of it! We're experts!" they shout. __They're not wrong, they're just assholes__. They bill hourse based on the whims of an account-manager that has very little (if any) idea of what realisation would entail. They invent SLA's that bleed companies dry. Well, not all the time. Some companies have a LOT of blood.  

I'm going off on a tangent here, but it sort of ties together. Watch me do the dippity-doo. Keeping up with the state of the art in any fast developing field is hard. If it's hard for domain experts, __of course__ it's hard for lamen. You can't fault a business-person for not wanting to take risks where he/she (gender neutrality is important!) sees them, even if they're not really there. That's why a good consultant would be worth so much, but too much of that and you end up with IBM/Accenture/Capgemeni all over again.
