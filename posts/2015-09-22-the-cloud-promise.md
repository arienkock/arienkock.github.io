## The Cloud Promise: has it delivered?

Yes it has, and we're all to blame. I am no longer satisfied with old-fashioned hosting. I want my storage to grow on-demand. I want zero data loss, 100% guaranteed. I want global CDN and Geo DNS routing trafic to my clusters spread around 3 continents. I want to be billed by the minute and I want to scale up and down based on server load. I don't care if it's only a blog, I want it all!

Cloud offerings are amazing. They really are. They're also a bit like a buffet. Just looking at all that goodness makes your mouth water. 

Cloud is no longer JUST a buzzword, but are we really clear on what it means? Is cloud simply highly-available services? Almost everything is load-balanced. Is it not caring about hardware? Oh I can not care, watch how hard I can _not_ care.
