<h1 class="articleTitle">Misunderstanding Java Interfaces</h1>
<div class="posted-on-date">Posted on 2015-7-25</div>
<p>I used to think interfaces were a premature abstraction. In other words: something you did so that you could migrate or switch implementations/providers in some not so probable future. In all my software engineering classes the true value of decoupling was never explained to me in such a way that it made me a believer. After an unpleasant experience programming against interfaces as a junior programmer I found them quite distasteful.</p>
<h2 id="dai-dao">DAI &amp; DAO</h2>
<p>I was 25 years old and I had just started my first job as a developer. When I opened up my IDE and explored the codebase, I came across the data-access layer of the code. &quot;Data Access Interfaces&quot; (DAI&#39;s) and &quot;Data Access Objects&quot; (DAO&#39;s), you say? Well, I guess that makes sense. After all, I remember my professors saying it was good to separate the public API from the implementation. A few months in I wasn&#39;t so convinced. The DAO&#39;s were ever changing and evolving. I wasn&#39;t as comfortable with my IDE at the time, so all this jumping back and forth between interfaces and implementations, keeping them up to date as you &quot;tried stuff out&quot; was a real pain in the ass. The number DAI/DAO&#39;s was growing and I couldn&#39;t make sense of what purpose they served. The DAO implementations were <em>right there</em>! I could cast down to them or use them directly, and why wouldn&#39;t I?</p>
<p>I asked my senior colleague to explain this to me and he unintentionally struck another blow to my already damaged faith in interfaces. He said </p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Well, what if we ever want to replace the persistence code with something else. Then we wouldn&#39;t have to rewrite all the other classes that only know about the DAI&#39;s.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I wasn&#39;t satisfied with that! We were not exercising any constraint while changing the DAI&#39;s. That&#39;s going to be a hell of a migration if that ever happens. Would that ever happen? (It wasn&#39;t, it turns out.) Was it worth the time invested in maintaining the interfaces? Also, if we didn&#39;t use interfaces and we DID have to migrate, couldn&#39;t we just make the DAO&#39;s into interfaces then sweep up the implementation from under it?</p>
<p>So was the young naive me wrong? The DAI&#39;s were a form of decoupling, and that&#39;s good, right? When I think back now I realise it was bit more complicated than that. It&#39;s a question of design and architecture.</p>
<h2 id="7-years-later">7 years later</h2>
<p>The true value of interfaces became clear to me over time. I wish I could point to a single event where it &quot;clicked&quot;, but I can&#39;t for the life of me think of one such moment. Interfaces <strong>are</strong> about decoupling, but <strong>where</strong> we decouple is important. Where we draw our lines is informed by <strong>why</strong> we decouple. Reasons like maintainability, composability etc. Choosing these places to separate responsibilities takes careful consideration.</p>
<p>I&#39;m currently refactoring a relatively young project. I&#39;m trying to split up the code according to <a href="https://blog.8thlight.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html">the clean architecture</a> and the dependency rule. If your code is all contained in one software bundle, then there is no stopping any piece of code from talking to the other. There is a giant pitfall for a developer of simply bypassing the <em>correct</em> component, assuming there is one. If you decided to forgo structuring your code into components, as you might when just starting out, then there is not even a <em>hint</em> in the code to let a developer know that they&#39;re spaghettifying the application. However, once you decide on what a component is and what its contract with the outside world is, sticking to it is your only weapon against the <a href="http://martinfowler.com/articles/designDead.html">increasing entropy of your design</a>. Sticking to self-imposed rules takes discipline, and that&#39;s <strong>not</strong> something everyone is blessed with.</p>
<p>When you separate concerns you can do so in varying degrees. Part of the way: Introduce a naming convention or namespaces. All the way: make any code that is not part of the public interface invisible or otherwise unreachable from the other modules. When going the second route, you&#39;re making it so hard to do the wrong thing that anyone trying to screw up would have to make an effort. I&#39;m a strong believer in making the &quot;right thing&quot; easier to do than the wrong thing (a.k.a. <a href="http://blog.codinghorror.com/falling-into-the-pit-of-success/">falling into the pit of success</a>). Applying this whenever you design an API or in the case of code: project structure. Interfaces are one of several tools you can use to achieve this. However, if you leave it at simply <em>having</em> interfaces, it can be hard to understand why they&#39;re there. If it&#39;s clear that they represent a boundary, because they are opaque, then respecting that boundary becomes easy because it&#39;s necessary. As a result, you&#39;ll write cleaner code.</p>
