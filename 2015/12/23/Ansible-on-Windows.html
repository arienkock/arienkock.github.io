<h1 class="articleTitle">Ansible on Windows</h1>
<div class="posted-on-date">Posted on 2015-12-23</div>
<p>When I wanted to try out Ansible on my dev machine I felt like booting a sufficiently large EC2 instance was a bit of a waste. So, I used Vagrant. Vagrant makes using VirtualBox directly seem like a terrible chore. So this is what you need to start playing around with Ansible on Windows.</p>
<h2 id="install-vagrant">Install Vagrant</h2>
<p>Requires VirtualBox to run as the default provider on Windows.</p>
<h2 id="create-two-vm-s">Create two VM&#39;s</h2>
<p>One Ansible host (let&#39;s call it VM1) and one Ansible target (let&#39;s call it VM2). The separate target machine is useful, because your Ansible playbooks will surely wreck the config at some point or cause side-effects that cause your commands to have different outcomes than you would have with a correct playbook. Now you can tear down VM2 whenever you need to and apply the playbook to a fresh machine. To keep the environment lite (low memory usage), consider using one of these <a href="https://atlas.hashicorp.com/minimal">minimal boxes</a> for the host VM1 and maybe even the target (depending on your needs). Run the following command twice in separate directories.</p>
<pre><code>vagrant init minimal/trusty64
</code></pre><h2 id="install-ansible-on-vm1">Install Ansible on VM1</h2>
<p>Read <a href="http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/intro_installation.html">the documentation for your OS</a>.</p>
<h2 id="configure-a-static-ip-address-for-vm2">Configure a static IP address for VM2</h2>
<p>You don&#39;t want to have to update your Ansible configuration (the inventory file) each time your Ansible target gets a new IP address. So, somewhere in your <code>Vagrantfile</code> set something along the lines of:</p>
<pre><code>config.vm.network &quot;private_network&quot;, ip: &quot;192.168.33.10&quot;
</code></pre><p>Now start both VM&#39;s running <code>vagrant up</code> in the two directories.</p>
<h2 id="setup-password-less-authentication-between-ansible-host-and-target">Setup password-less authentication between Ansible host and target</h2>
<p>Since all Ansible commands run over SSH by default and Vagrant uses private_key authentication, the host has to be known and trusted on the target machine. Since (by default, anyway) there is no password for VM2 you can&#39;t use <code>ssh-copy-id</code>. You can perform this step in several ways, but this is the way I did it:</p>
<p>On VM1 run <code>ssh-keygen</code> to generate a key pair (use default values for every prompt). Copy the resulting <code>/home/vagrant/.ssh/id_rsa.pub</code> public key file to the <code>/vagrant/</code> directory on VM1. </p>
<p>Since Vagrant automounts this directory to the same directory your Vagrantfile is in, you now have access to the <code>id_rsa.pub</code> file on your Windows machine. Now copy that file to VM2&#39;s directory which is also automounted giving you access to the file inside VM2. </p>
<p>Now, append the contents of the file to the <code>authorized_keys</code> file running <code>cat id_rsa.pub &gt;&gt; ~/.ssh/authorized_keys</code>. Now your identity on VM1 is known and trusted on VM2.</p>
<h2 id="try-it-out">Try it out</h2>
<p>Create the inventory file on VM1 contianing only VM2&#39;s IP address: <code>sudo sh -c &quot;echo 192.168.33.10 &gt; /etc/ansible/hosts&quot;</code>. Now, run your first ad-hoc play (don&#39;t worry about the terminology if you&#39;re just getting started): <code>ansible all -m setup</code>. If you&#39;re having connection issues, make sure the IP address is pointing to VM2&#39;s IP address on your windows machine (the IP addresses in the commands on this page are just examples).</p>
