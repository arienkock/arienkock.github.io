<p>I hope this post will save someone from the frustration I&#39;ve lived through trying to get this to work.</p>
<p>The RMI JMX ConnectorServer (what a name!) is the component that responds to the client when you try to load your MBeans into Visual VM or JConsole. The RMI documentation is pretty clear that a secondary connection is opened up which serves the actual remote object stub. This is why Jetty comes with a component that makes this slightly easier by unifying the ports. Did I lose you? I think it&#39;s likely that most Java devs don&#39;t work with RMI very often. Suffice it to say, two connections are required to get your JMX MBeans data. </p>
<p>It was my grave mistake to assume that: Since, the second connection&#39;s endpoint is in the service URL (e.g. <code>service:jmx:rmi://&lt;TARGET_MACHINE&gt;:&lt;JMX_RMI_SERVER_PORT&gt;/jndi/rmi://&lt;TARGET_MACHINE&gt;:&lt;RMI_REGISTRY_PORT&gt;/jmxrmi</code>), that must also be the endpoint my client actually uses. Surely that would make sense. However, RMI (rightfully) doesn&#39;t know or care about JMX. So, RMI just knows that it needs to respond to the initial request with an IP and a port. That IP address is where things go wrong on EC2. EC2 instances don&#39;t know their external IP address. None of the network interfaces have it bound, so it cannot be resolved purely inside the instance. In <code>/$JETTY_HOME/etc/jetty-jmx-remote.xml</code> you can set a system property which tells the RMI Registry what its hostname is:</p>
<pre><code>  &lt;Call class=&quot;java.lang.System&quot; name=&quot;setProperty&quot;&gt;
    &lt;Arg&gt;java.rmi.server.hostname&lt;/Arg&gt;
    &lt;Arg&gt;[ec2_ip].[availability_zone].compute.amazonaws.com&lt;/Arg&gt;
  &lt;/Call&gt;
</code></pre><p>Now it will respond with something that makes sense to the outside world.</p>
<p>This wouldn&#39;t have been a problem if Visual VM or JConsole gave more information than just <em>&quot;I can&#39;t connect, yo&quot;</em>. Writing a test application finally gave me a hint when I saw the instance&#39;s internal IP show up in the exception. RMI is pretty cool, considering how old it is. Cool, &quot;Yes&quot;. Intuitive and user friendly, &quot;No&quot;.</p>
